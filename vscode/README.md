This is a vscode extension to help sort text & lists in a scoped manner. It's
part of a bigger project called [scopedsort](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/).
[Documentation](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/docs) and
[examples](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/examples) are mainly held there.

## Why

Vscode already provides commands for sorting
(`editor.action.sortLinesDescending` and `editor.action.sortLinesAscending`).
There are also tons of extensions for sorting, so why use this extension?

### Indentation Awareness

Most sorters do not keep track of indentation and sort line by line.
This leads to some undesired sorts:

![the problem with most sort implementation](assets/non-scope-problem.png)

This was the initial reason I created this extension, which is why
it's called "scopedsort".

### Standardization & Utility

This project is implemented on vscode, npm, the command line and a website. They
all share the same options and output.

A big part of this tool is [sort-comments](#sort-comments). I am not aware of
any other project that allows for you to specify a section to repeatedly sort.

### Options

This extension has a lot of options, all of which can be used together (provided
they don't conflict logically). Other extensions like
[tyriar.sort-lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.sort-lines)
have a reasonable amount of options, but they don't have a nice way to combine
them, so they end up polluting the command contributions with 8+ commands. And
even then they don't allow for all the possibilities.

Some of the more extensive options this extension implements include:
custom-sort-orders, sort-by-column, sort-by-regex, etc...

This is one of the less valid points though, since you won't need these
advanced options often.

## Disclaimer

This extension might have a bit of a learning curve and does require some reading.
Most sorting cases can be solved with
[tyriar.sort-lines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tyriar.sort-lines).

This extension is not meant for sorting words inside a line, nor is it trying
to sort language specific things like imports or properties of an object
(although it can sort them if they have a simple structure).

I am not a fan of adding extensions unless they are important, so I should also
inform you of the other mediums this project has:
([cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-content-sort-cli) &
[website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-content-sort-cli)).
This might serve better for most users.

If you only need to sort text on occasions, the website has you covered. If you
are sorting certain sections or files repeatedly, the cli tool might be better.
It's quicker and more automatable.

The only instances I see this extension being more efficient than the other
mediums is if you are sorting a lot of different text only once or if you are
using the helper command `scoped-sort.addSurroundingSortComments`.

## Demos / Previews

Command:

Note this example is technically outdated since it uses `re`, which now should
be `-re`.

Sort on save:

![sort on save gif demo](assets/sort-on-save.gif)

If you want to see examples of how the program sorts certain text, visit [examples](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/examples).

## Usage

This command contributes three commands: `scoped-sort.sort`,
`scoped-sort.sortComments`, `scoped-sort.addSurroundingSortComments`.

All three of these commands work on text that is selected. If no text
is selected it will use the whole document.

The main command: `scoped-sort.sort` simply takes in text and sorts with the
options given. Options are given through a cli-like interface in a prompt.
Valid arguments include:
`--reverse`, `--recursive 3`, `--unique`, ...

For actual options read the [documentation](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/docs).

The second command: `scoped-sort.sortComments` sorts only
[sort-comment sections](#sort-comments) in the given selection.

The last command: `scoped-sort.addSurroundingSortComments` is a helper command
to generate sort-comments. It will add a line before and after the selection to
specify a sort-comment section.

```text
3
1
2
```

will (usually\*) turn into

```text
// { sort-start }
3
1
2
// { sort-end }
```

\*: depends on the file type and your configuration

To use the command, first select the text you want to sort, or don't, and it'll
use the entire document. Next go to your command pallete (usually with
`ctrl+shift+p`), type 'scoped sort', and select the command you want.

### Sort-on-save

To use the sort-on-save feature, you need to mark sections with [sort-comments](#sort-comments).
Next you need to go to your configuration and turn on `scoped-sort.formatSectionsOnSave`.

Although personally again, I would advise against using sort-on-save, and
instead use the cli version of this project.

### Sort Comments

sort-comments are a way for this program to recognize a section to sort. This
can help if you have a list that is constantly being updated, and you donâ€™t want
to have to keep manually sorting.

Example:

```js
// { sort-start --regex /['"]/ }
import react from 'react';
import express from 'express';
import isIsOdd from 'is-is-odd';
// { sort-end }
```

Read the
[actual documentation](https://scopedsort.netlify.app/docs#sort-comments) for
more.

## Configuration

All the configuration is under `scoped-sort`. Visit your settings to change them.

`scoped-sort.prompt`: boolean

Decides if the program should always prompt/ask for options when executing the
main command.

Default: `true`

`scoped-sort.formatSectionsOnSave`: boolean

Decides if the program should try to format sort-comment sections on save.

Default: `false`

`scoped-sort.defaultArgs`: object

This is an object which defines the default arguments used in situations.
The properties of this object are all strings which follow the cli-like arguments.
All the defaults are empty strings.

`scoped-sort.defaultArgs.prompt`: string

When you call the main command, if you have `scoped-sort.prompt` set to true,
this string will be injected into the prompt box.

`scoped-sort.defaultArgs.no-prompt`: string

When you call the main command, if you have `scoped-sort.prompt` set to false,
the command will execute with this value

`scoped-sort.defaultArgs.addSurroundingSortComments`: string

When you call the `addSurroundingSortComments` command, the sort-start comment
will have this value as its arguments.

For example, if the value was: `--random-sort`, when you use the command on the
following text:

```text
a
z
b
```

it will turn into

```text
// { sort-start --random-sort }
a
z
b
// { sort-end }
```

## Adding Keybindings

If you are planning on adding keybindings on the `scoped-sort.sort` command. You
can also use the `.args` property to provide arguments. This will make it so no
prompt shows

For example:

```json
{
    "key": "ctrl+shift+m",
    "command": "scoped-sort.sort",
    "args": "-sur"
}
```

A small amount of telemetry is recorded to see how many active users there are for each version.
IP address is taken in as the unique key but then hashed with SHA256.
